    My name is Madubuike Kyrian.I joined Flip To Tech on the 11th of September, 2023.
 the reason I ventured into tech was because I wanted to be a game programmer although it did not work out
 my future ambition is to be a medical doctor or a genetic engineer. I may also be a software developer or
 web developer as a side career.
    This is my assignment.
